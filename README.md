# Homing arrows

Hi, Homing arrows is a small plugin I made.
When you shoot bow or crossbow and it has the Homing enchantment it will go to the entity nearest to the player.


## How to install
 1. Clone the project
 2. Clean install
 3. Copy the homing arrows from the target folder into the plugins folder
