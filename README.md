# Homing arrows

Hi, Homing arrows is a small plugin I made.
When you shoot bow or crossbow and it has the Homing enchantment it will go to the entity nearest to the player.
Have fun


## How to install
 1. Clone the project
 2. Clean install
 3. Copy the homing arrows from the target folder into the plugins folder
 
 ## What if it does not work
  1. Please send me a message on github so i can fix it
